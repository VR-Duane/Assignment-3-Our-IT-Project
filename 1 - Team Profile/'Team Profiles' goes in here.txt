Steven Career Plan:
My career plan is to start working anywhere in I.T involving programming or data analytics where I am able to get experience with the I.T environment whilst obtain as much knowledge as I can. I will most likely pursue programming or game development jobs once I am comfortable with my skills and when I am confident that I will be successful. My end goal is to become a game developer or something similar.

Duane Career Plan:
Currently, my career plan is to try find any job relating to I.T and/or Design as these are the two things I am most passionate about. Any job that gives me the ability to improve my skills in a proper work environment will be the best option I believe. For design based jobs, ideally, I'd like to find a job as a Graphics Designer or UI Designer for apps and websites. These can also relate to my passsion for learning different types of Information Technologies. My goal overall is to be a digital artist who can create art and potentially sell online. Different jobs in design and technologies will assist me in achieving this goal.

Group process
For assignment two; in general, we all agree that we worked well in assignment two. Communication was good within the group, with people constantly communicating on Facebook messenger. There was also always at least 1 or 2 group members available at any given time to help out fellow group members.
In moving forward, our group will take addition steps to make sure that the assignment is finished on time. Processâ€™s that we will implement for this assignment include: better time management and distributing work load evenly. We will implement a better time management process by adding deadlines for each part of the assignment, as well as also submitting all the work we have done each week, so other members are aware of where people are at in the assignment. We will also plan out our work load before we start the assignment before we start, so that everyone is working evenly on the assignment and not 1 person taking all the work load.
