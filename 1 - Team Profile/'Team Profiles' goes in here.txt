Aaron Career Plan


Group process
For assignment two; in general, we all agree that we worked well in assignment two. Communication was good within the group, with people constantly communicating on Facebook messenger. There was also always at least 1 or 2 group members available at any given time to help out fellow group members.
In moving forward, our group will take addition steps to make sure that the assignment is finished on time. Processâ€™s that we will implement for this assignment include: better time management and distributing work load evenly. We will implement a better time management process by adding deadlines for each part of the assignment, as well as also submitting all the work we have done each week, so other members are aware of where people are at in the assignment. We will also plan out our work load before we start the assignment before we start, so that everyone is working evenly on the assignment and not 1 person taking all the work load.
