Steven's Group reflection:
Once again, the communication between the group members have been consistent and regular. Keeping the same routine as the previous assignment, in relation to communication and decision making, made the whole process of completing all tasks much simpler.
Something can could be improved upon is regular commits into github. This is so that everyone knows where everyone is, in terms of tasks completed. Again, everyone was doing their part, however, regular contributions into github would be beneficial to everyone.
One surprising thing in this assignment, coming from Assignment 2, is that we improved on some of the suggested improvements that were listed in Assignment 2, such as group members finishing their part of the report much earlier than the due date rather than within the last few days.
Some key lessons about groups include the communication between the entire group and also between individuals since everyone had a specific job with the project idea and the report. Everyone had to keep up with one another and find out what is happening and what has been done so that the progress can move forwards.
